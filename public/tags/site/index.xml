      <description>Welcome to my Digital Garden! This is the place where I share my knowledge with everyone on the Web and with myself.
Notes are drafts or pre-complete materials that I could use for writing articles on my blog.
I take notes following Zettelkasten method and I use Obsidian app for this. Some notes might contain a format that is working in Obsidian well but could be not supported by my website (yet).</description>
